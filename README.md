# 🚀 Smart Issue Tracker — Priority-Driven Issue Management System

**React | Node.js | Express | MongoDB | Java | Data Structures**

A full-stack issue tracking system that dynamically ranks issues using a custom priority engine based on severity, frequency, and user impact.  
Designed to simulate real-world production bug triaging and task prioritization workflows used by engineering teams.

## ✨ Highlights (Quick Scan)

- ⚡ Priority-based issue ranking using weighted scoring logic  
- 🧠 Custom priority engine using Java heap & comparator concepts  
- 🔄 Automatic re-prioritization when issues are reported multiple times  
- 📊 RESTful API with MongoDB for fast issue retrieval  
- 🎨 Premium React UI with clean issue cards  
- 🔗 End-to-end frontend ↔ backend integration  
- 📈 Strong focus on system design and algorithmic thinking

## 🧠 How It Works (High Level)

User interacts with React UI  
⬇  
Frontend sends REST API request  
⬇  
Node.js + Express backend processes issue data  
⬇  
Priority score is calculated using weighted logic  
⬇  
Issues are stored and sorted in MongoDB by priority score  
⬇  
Ranked issues are rendered back in the UI

## 🧩 Core Feature — Priority Engine

Each issue is assigned a priority score using a weighted formula:
```
priorityScore = (severity × 5) + (frequency × 3) + (userImpact × 4)
```


### Rationale
- Severity reflects technical risk  
- Frequency reflects urgency and recurrence  
- User Impact reflects business importance  

This mirrors real-world engineering decision-making systems.

## 🔌 API Endpoints

- **POST /issues**  
  Create a new issue and calculate priority score  

- **GET /issues**  
  Fetch all issues sorted by priority score  

- **PATCH /issues/:id/report**  
  Increment issue frequency and re-calculate priority  

- **PATCH /issues/:id/status**  
  Update issue status

## 🧠 Data Model (Issue)

- title: String  
- description: String  
- severity: Number  
- frequency: Number  
- userImpact: Number  
- priorityScore: Number  
- status: String  
- timestamps
